# Plan to Improve Transformer Performance Beyond Current Results

## Current Performance Analysis
- **Current achievement**: 900-964 rejections (70% success rate)
- **Validation accuracy**: 53.3% (room for improvement)
- **Training loss**: 0.615 (relatively high)
- **Model size**: 4.8M parameters
- **Training data**: 37,418 elite games

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Supervised Learning (Immediate improvements)

#### Data Augmentation
- Generate synthetic "perfect" games with optimal decisions
- Add noise and perturbations to existing successful trajectories
- Create adversarial examples near constraint boundaries

#### Architecture Improvements
- Add attention mechanism between constraint and efficiency heads
- Implement residual connections in decision networks
- Add batch normalization for better gradient flow
- Increase model depth (8-10 transformer layers instead of 6)

#### Training Enhancements
- Use curriculum learning (train on easier games first, then harder)
- Implement focal loss to focus on hard examples
- Add mixup augmentation for better generalization
- Use label smoothing to prevent overconfidence

### 2. Reinforcement Learning Fine-tuning (RL on top)

#### PPO Fine-tuning
- Use current transformer as initialization
- Define reward function: -1 per rejection, +1000 for meeting constraints
- Add intermediate rewards for constraint progress
- Use self-play to generate new training data

#### DQN with Experience Replay
- Build Q-network on top of transformer features
- Use prioritized experience replay for hard decisions
- Implement double DQN to reduce overestimation

#### Actor-Critic with Transformer Backbone
- Use constraint head as critic (value function)
- Use efficiency head as actor (policy)
- Train with A2C or A3C for stability

### 3. Hybrid Approach: Imitation + RL

#### GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning)
- Train discriminator to distinguish expert from generated trajectories
- Use RL to maximize discriminator confusion
- Combine with behavior cloning loss

#### Offline RL on Historical Data
- Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) on existing games
- Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) for safe policy improvement
- Decision Transformer fine-tuning with RTG conditioning

### 4. Advanced Techniques

#### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Integration
- Use transformer for value/policy estimates
- Run shallow MCTS for critical decisions
- Cache and learn from MCTS improvements

#### Ensemble Methods
- Train multiple transformers with different seeds
- Use weighted voting based on confidence
- Implement knowledge distillation to single model

#### Meta-Learning
- Train on multiple scenarios simultaneously
- Learn to adapt quickly to new constraint configurations
- Implement MAML or Reptile for few-shot adaptation

## Specific Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Immediate SL Improvements (1-2 days)
1. Increase training epochs to 100-150
2. Add curriculum learning with staged difficulty
3. Implement focal loss for hard examples
4. Add attention between heads
5. Use larger batch size (32-64) with gradient accumulation

### Phase 2: RL Fine-tuning (3-4 days)
1. Implement PPO trainer using transformer as base
2. Define shaped reward function with constraint bonuses
3. Run self-play for 1000+ episodes
4. Fine-tune for 20-30 RL epochs
5. Use KL divergence penalty to prevent catastrophic forgetting

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
1. Run 100+ games to measure improvement
2. Target: <700 rejections consistently
3. Analyze failure modes
4. Iterate on reward shaping

## Expected Outcomes
- **Target performance**: 650-750 rejections (vs current 900-964)
- **Success rate**: 85-90% (vs current 70%)
- **More consistent results** with lower variance
- **Better constraint satisfaction** with fewer close calls
- **Improved early game** decisions through curriculum learning

## Technical Requirements
- GPU with 16GB+ VRAM for RL training
- ~48-72 hours total training time
- 100k+ self-play episodes for RL
- Careful hyperparameter tuning
- Robust evaluation framework

## Key Insights for Implementation

### Why RL Will Help
1. **Current limitation**: Supervised learning only mimics past behavior
2. **RL advantage**: Can explore and find better strategies than training data
3. **Self-improvement**: Generate new high-quality trajectories through self-play
4. **Constraint awareness**: RL can learn complex constraint trade-offs

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Reward shaping**: Balance efficiency vs constraint satisfaction
2. **Exploration**: Ensure sufficient exploration near constraint boundaries
3. **Stability**: Use KL penalties to prevent policy collapse
4. **Curriculum**: Start with easier constraint targets, gradually increase difficulty

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Catastrophic forgetting**: Use elastic weight consolidation (EWC)
2. **Reward hacking**: Carefully validate reward function
3. **Overfitting**: Use diverse scenarios in training
4. **Instability**: Monitor KL divergence and gradient norms

## Conclusion
This plan combines the best of supervised learning improvements with reinforcement learning to push beyond the current performance ceiling. The transformer's strong baseline (already beating the 716 record) provides an excellent foundation for RL fine-tuning, which should enable us to achieve sub-700 rejection rates consistently.
