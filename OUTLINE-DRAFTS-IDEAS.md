### Key Research Data
- **Elite Games Found**: 162 games out of 3,902 total
- **Best Performance**: RBCR with 781 rejections
- **Solver Count**: 30+ strategies implemented
- **LSTM Experiments**: 58 training runs logged
- **Total Project Duration**: One intense day of development
- **Local Simulator**: Built due to API limitations (rate limits, downtime, max 10 parallel games)
- **Code Repository**: https://github.com/nibzard/berghain-challenge-bot

### Collaboration Notes
- Claude did majority of implementation work (95%)
- Human provided direction, insights, and problem-solving guidance  
- GPT-5 used for code review and getting unstuck
- Other agents (ampcode) helped with strategic decisions when Claude hit token limits

### Growth Marketing Analysis Added
- **Listen's Viral Success**: 3000x user growth (10 → 30,000)
- **Viral Coefficient**: 3000x with 1.1M organic impressions
- **Cost Per User**: ~$1 (billboard cost / 30,000 users)
- **Community Psychology**: Mystery → Community → Challenge → Status
- **Infrastructure as Marketing**: API crashes became authenticity signals

### Article Themes to Emphasize
1. **Human-AI Collaboration**: The dance between intuition and implementation
2. **Rapid Prototyping**: From idea to code in seconds
3. **Domain Expertise**: Why context matters more than raw compute
4. **Iterative Discovery**: How we evolved from simple to sophisticated
5. **The Joy of Problem Solving**: The addictive nature of optimization
6. **Viral Growth Marketing**: How Listen's 3000x growth hack worked
7. **Technical Community Psychology**: Why engineers love hard problems
8. **Infrastructure as Marketing**: How API crashes became features
9. **Growth + Engineering Synthesis**: When marketing meets obsession

### Code Snippets to Include
- [ ] Initial greedy solver (the failure)
- [ ] RBCR dual computation (the breakthrough)
- [ ] LSTM architecture (the over-engineering)
- [ ] Elite game hunter (the data mining)
- [ ] Performance comparison table

### Writing Style Notes
- Use Gary Provost's rhythm principles (vary sentence length)
- Channel Clayton Christensen's pragmatic clarity
- Adopt Hemingway's directness and brevity
- Keep energy high with short sentences and quick pacing
- Include actual dialogue between human and AI

### Next Steps
1. Start with Part 1 - establish the hook and context
2. Build momentum through the discovery narrative
3. Include technical depth without losing readability
4. End with actionable insights for other developers

### Ideas Parking Lot
- Include a section on the psychology of optimization addiction
- Discuss the broader implications for software development
- Maybe add a timeline visualization of our progression
- Consider including failed experiments for humor and learning

### Quotes to Remember
- "It's deceptively simple until you realize you're basically solving a constrained optimization problem in real-time with incomplete information"
- "The AI gave me superpowers, but I still had to tell it which direction to fly"
- "We went from 1000+ rejections to 781. That's not just optimization, that's obsession."
