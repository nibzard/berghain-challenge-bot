# Plan to Achieve <716 Rejections While Meeting All Constraints

## Goal: Beat 716 rejections while achieving 600+ young, 600+ well_dressed, 1000 admitted

## Current Analysis

### Current Performance:
- **Global Best**: 716 rejections (the record to beat)
- **Constraint-Focused LSTM**: 875-914 rejections (meets constraints but 159-198 rejections worse than record)
- **Best Strategy Performance**:
  - optimal: 538 rejections (but fails constraints)
  - rbcr2: 761 rejections
  - rbcr: 781 rejections
  - ultimate3h: 807 rejections
  - dual: 810 rejections

### Key Issues to Address:
1. **875 rejections is good but not optimal** - we're 159 rejections away from the 716 record
2. **Too conservative** - admitted only 976/1000 (left 24 spots unused)
3. **Over-achieving constraints** - 609 young (9 extra), 600 well_dressed (exact)

## Phase 1: Optimize Current Model Performance

### 1. Fine-tune Constraint-Focused LSTM thresholds
- Reduce constraint safety margins (currently too conservative)
- Use all 1000 capacity slots (currently only using 976)
- Target exactly 600/600 constraints, not 609/600

### 2. Improve LSTM training data quality
- Add more <800 rejection games from top strategies
- Focus on games that achieve exactly 600/600 constraints
- Weight training by rejection efficiency (lower is better)

## Phase 2: Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 3. Implement Perfect Constraint Balancing
- Track exact deficit at all times
- Calculate minimum acceptance rate needed
- Implement dynamic thresholds based on game progress
- Use linear programming to optimize decisions

### 4. Create Hybrid Approach
- Early game: Use aggressive filtering (reject non-essential)
- Mid game: Balance constraint progress
- Late game: Fill exact deficits with precision
- Emergency mode: Accept only critical attributes

## Phase 3: Ensemble and Advanced Strategies

### 5. Ensemble Multiple Models
- Combine LSTM predictions with optimal control theory
- Use voting mechanism for borderline decisions
- Weight models by their constraint satisfaction history

### 6. Implement Lookahead Optimization
- Predict future attribute distribution
- Reserve capacity for expected high-value people
- Use Monte Carlo simulation for decision evaluation

## Phase 4: Final Optimizations

### 7. Dynamic Strategy Switching
- Start with optimal strategy (538 rejections baseline)
- Switch to constraint-focused when approaching limits
- Use LSTM for complex middle-game decisions

### 8. Constraint Relaxation Technique
- Accept slight over-admission in one constraint
- To create room for exact satisfaction of others
- Target 600-605 range, not 609+

## Implementation Priority:

### Immediate (Quick wins):
- Adjust constraint thresholds to use all 1000 slots
- Reduce safety margins from 9 extra to 0-3 extra
- Fine-tune confidence thresholds

### Short-term (Major improvements):
- Train on optimal strategy games (538 rejection baseline)
- Implement perfect constraint balancing
- Add lookahead optimization

### Long-term (Breaking the record):
- Ensemble approach combining best strategies
- Dynamic strategy switching
- Monte Carlo decision evaluation

## Expected Results:
- **Current**: 875-914 rejections (100% success)
- **After Phase 1**: ~800-850 rejections (100% success)
- **After Phase 2**: ~750-800 rejections (100% success)
- **After Phase 3**: ~700-750 rejections (100% success)
- **Final Target**: <716 rejections (BEAT THE RECORD!)

## How We'll Close the 159-Rejection Gap:
1. Using all 1000 capacity (24 more admits = ~50 fewer rejections)
2. Reducing over-achievement (9 fewer = ~20 fewer rejections)
3. Better early-game filtering (~50 fewer rejections)
4. Optimal strategy hybrid (~40 fewer rejections)

**Total expected improvement: ~160 rejections â†’ Target: 715 rejections or better!**
