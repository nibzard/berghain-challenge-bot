# Berghain RL Training Guide

This implementation adds reinforcement learning capabilities to your Berghain game solver using LSTM-based policy networks trained with PPO.

## Quick Start

### 1. Collect Expert Data
```bash
# Collect expert trajectories from existing game logs
python train_rl_model.py --mode collect --game-logs-dir game_logs --max-trajectories 500
```

### 2. Train RL Model
```bash
# Train with behavioral cloning pre-training + PPO
python train_rl_model.py --mode ppo --pretrain-bc --total-timesteps 1000000 --num-envs 4

# Or just behavioral cloning
python train_rl_model.py --mode bc --bc-epochs 100
```

### 3. Evaluate Model
```bash
# Compare RL model against baseline strategies
python evaluate_rl_model.py --model-path models/berghain_rl_best.pth --num-games 100 --eval-hybrid
```

### 4. Use in Production
```bash
# Run games with RL strategy
python main.py run --scenario 1 --strategy rl_lstm --count 10

# Or with hybrid safety rules
python main.py run --scenario 1 --strategy rl_lstm_hybrid --count 10
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **LSTM Policy Network** (`berghain/training/lstm_policy.py`)
   - Dual-headed architecture (policy + value)
   - Maintains temporal context across decisions
   - State: person attributes + game progress + capacity usage

2. **Training Environment** (`berghain/training/rl_environment.py`)
   - Gym-like interface for experience collection
   - Reward shaping for constraint satisfaction
   - Support for local simulation or API calls

3. **PPO Trainer** (`berghain/training/ppo_trainer.py`)
   - Proximal Policy Optimization with GAE
   - Parallel environment collection
   - Wandb integration for monitoring

4. **Expert Data Collection** (`berghain/training/data_collector.py`)
   - Converts game logs to training trajectories
   - Behavioral cloning dataset creation
   - Strategy success rate filtering

### State Representation
```python
[
    well_dressed,           # 0/1: Person has well_dressed attribute
    young,                  # 0/1: Person has young attribute  
    constraint_progress_y,  # 0-1+: Progress toward young constraint
    constraint_progress_w,  # 0-1+: Progress toward well_dressed constraint
    capacity_ratio,         # 0-1: Admitted count / 1000
    rejection_ratio,        # 0-1: Rejected count / 20000
    game_phase,            # 0/0.5/1: Early/mid/late game phase
    person_index_norm      # 0-1: Normalized temporal position
]
```

### Reward Function
- **+1** per needed attribute when accepting helpful person
- **+0.5** bonus for dual-attribute people  
- **-0.5** penalty for over-acceptance after constraints met
- **+0.1** bonus for rejecting non-helpful people
- **+10** game completion bonus, **-10** failure penalty
- **+2×efficiency** bonus based on rejection count

## Training Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection
- Analyze existing game logs from successful strategies
- Filter by minimum success rate (default: 80%)
- Convert to sequential experience format
- Create balanced dataset across scenarios

### Phase 2: Behavioral Cloning (Optional)
- Pre-train policy to mimic expert demonstrations
- Provides good initialization for PPO training
- Typically 50-100 epochs with cross-entropy loss

### Phase 3: PPO Training
- Online experience collection from parallel environments
- Policy optimization with clipped objective
- Advantage estimation using GAE
- Early stopping based on success rate targets

### Phase 4: Evaluation
- Compare against baseline strategies (OGDS, Ultimate, etc.)
- Statistical significance testing
- Performance regression monitoring

## Configuration

### Strategy Configs
- `berghain/config/strategies/rl_lstm.yaml` - Pure RL strategy
- `berghain/config/strategies/rl_lstm_hybrid.yaml` - RL with safety rules

### Training Hyperparameters
```python
learning_rate: 3e-4
gamma: 0.99          # Discount factor
gae_lambda: 0.95     # GAE parameter
clip_ratio: 0.2      # PPO clip ratio
batch_size: 64       # Training batch size
num_envs: 4          # Parallel environments
```

## Expected Performance

Based on the problem structure, expect:
- **Success Rate**: 85-95% (vs 80-90% for hand-crafted strategies)
- **Efficiency**: 500-800 rejections (competitive with best existing methods)
- **Consistency**: Lower variance due to learned patterns
- **Adaptability**: Better handling of edge cases through experience

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Wandb Integration
```bash
python train_rl_model.py --mode ppo --wandb-project berghain-rl
```

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Success rate**: Target >85% for production use
- **Average reward**: Should increase steadily during training  
- **Policy entropy**: Shouldn't collapse too quickly
- **Value loss**: Should decrease and stabilize
- **Clip fraction**: ~10-30% indicates healthy learning

### Common Issues
1. **Low success rate**: Check reward function, increase training time
2. **High variance**: Reduce learning rate, increase batch size
3. **Policy collapse**: Increase entropy coefficient
4. **Poor constraint satisfaction**: Adjust reward shaping

## Extensions

### Multi-Scenario Training
- Train single model across scenarios 1-3
- Add scenario embedding to state representation
- Use curriculum learning (easy → hard scenarios)

### Advanced Architectures
- **Transformer Policy**: Better attention across sequence
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Model attribute correlations
- **Hierarchical RL**: High-level strategy + low-level tactics

### Offline RL Methods
- **Conservative Q-Learning (CQL)**: Learn from logged data only  
- **Implicit Q-Learning (IQL)**: Avoid distributional shift
- **Decision Transformer**: Sequence modeling approach
